# Jenkins-tutorial

Jenkins is a open-source continous integration tool/application. It provides following

     -> Continous build
     -> Continous deployment
     -> Testing
 
Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project. It is developed using java. So it is avaialble as a java web application package (Jenkins.war). It can be run by using web/application server.

-> Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.

To download Jenkins war refer website:
https://www.jenkins.io/download/

We can use Jenkins for CI/CD in any operating system like windows/Mac OS/Linux or in an isolated environment like Docker container.

Note: The recommended docker image to use the Jenkins in Docker platform is  jenkinsci/blueocean image (from the Docker Hub repository). This image contains the current Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Jenkins (which is production-ready) bundled with all Blue Ocean plugins and features. This means that you do not need to install the Blue Ocean plugins separately.

For more information to access Jenkins in docker platform refer website : https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/
